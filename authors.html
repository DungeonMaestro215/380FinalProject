                Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise? I thought not.
                It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis 
                was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to
                 influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark 
                 side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the
                  Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... 
                  the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. 
                  Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him 
                  in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

                    Hello! I'm Will and I'm a third-yeah at UNC majoring in computer science and minoring in geology. It rocks B). 
                    I found out about Raspberry Pi's at the beginning of college when I was looking into more ways of getting into 
                    computer science. I heard nothing but good things so I decided to buy one...that was my best decision ever.
                    I used it as a development platform for small projects like
                    mini games using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pygame.org/news">pygame</a> and as a way to learn how to
                    use the BASH terminal within a Linux distribution. Using this knowledge, I have even started using Linux as my primary 
                    operating system on my laptop. The Raspberry Pi has definitely made a meaning impact on my computer science 
                    career and I recommend anyone interested in computing to pick one up.
