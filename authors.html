                  <p>Hi, I'm Denver! And to answer your question: No, I have never been to the city. I am a 3rd-year
                    student
                    at UNC Chapel Hill working on a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics with a minor in
                    Physics (I know, yikes).
                    As you can see, I'm the perfect demographic for the Raspberry Pi. I bought my first Pi this past
                    summer after William
                    introduced me to them and have been having a blast using them for various projects ever since. 
                    My hobbies include playing chess, lifting weights, and programming. Lastly, I am a big supporter of 
                    Vim: learn it, live it, love it. Check
                    me out on twitter <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/massey_denver">@massey_denver</a>.

                    <p>
                      Hello! I'm Will and I'm a third-yeah at UNC majoring in computer science and minoring in geology.
                      It rocks B).
                      I found out about Raspberry Pi's at the beginning of college when I was looking into more ways of
                      getting into
                      computer science. I heard nothing but good things about them so I decided to buy one...that was my best
                      decision ever.
                      I used it as a development platform for small projects like
                      games using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pygame.org/news">pygame</a> and as a way to
                      learn how to
                      use the BASH terminal within a Linux distribution. Using this knowledge, I have even started using
                      Linux as my primary
                      operating system on my laptop. The Raspberry Pi has definitely made a meaningful impact on my
                      computer science
                      career. I recommend anyone interested in computing to pick one up.
