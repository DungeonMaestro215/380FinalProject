              <p>Hi, I'm Denver! And to answer your question: No, I have never been to the city. I am a 3rd-year student 
                at UNC Chapel Hill working on a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics with a minor in Physics (I know, yikes). 
                As you can see, I'm the perfect demographic for the Raspberry Pi. I bought my first Pi this past summer after William 
                introduced me to them and have been having a blast using them for various projects ever since. Also, check 
                me out on twitter <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/massey_denver">@massey_denver</a>.

                    Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise? I thought not.
                    It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis 
                    was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to
                     influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark 
                     side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the
                      Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... 
                      the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. 
                      Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him 
                      in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.
