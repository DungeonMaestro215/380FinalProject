          With their low cost and high versatility, these devices can be used for a wide
          variety of projects. We will present some of our own projects along with a non-exhaustive
          list of some of our favorite creations shared over the Internet.

            This <a target="_blank" href="https://dwes.copernicus.org/articles/12/31/2019/dwes-12-31-2019.html">scholarly article </a>
              discusses a device built on the Raspberry Pi platform to 
            monitor water quality in India. It is an interesting engineering problem of how 
            to make software use the computer hardware to measure the quality of water. 
            It is built using a simple Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) so anyone 
            could easily use the device and check their water quality. This device can also report 
            the data back to a main hub and allow the tracking of the water quality of all of India.

          <p>
            Here is another example of how the Raspberry Pi is helping researchers. 
            In Sogang University, South Korea, 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00371-018-1512-z">a team has created</a>
            what is known as a 4D Light Field 
            Camera Array which utilizes a Raspberry Pi cluster to render a graphical representation of 
            the photos taken. Although the physics goes beyond the scope of this website, we can still 
            appreciate the uses of such a device. 4D Light Fields are used often in 3D computer graphics 
            for video games or simulations. This device essentially allows you to record the 4D Light Field 
            of a real-world environment and translate it into a computer model. The researchers emphasize the 
            importance of the ease of creation and scalability of their design, and they owe this to the low cost 
            of the Pi and the modularity of the design.

            A place where you may not expect a Raspberry Pi is in self-driving car technology.

              In this article</a>,
            the team of researchers used lidar cameras attached to the Raspberry Pi to detect road signs and detect 
            what kind of sign it is. This is a big feat considering the limited computing power of the ARM processor 
            on the Raspberry Pi. The algorithm the team wrote captures the images and determines the kind of sign all 
            in 138 ms! The Raspberry Pi is a great platform for prototyping quickly allowing this team to constantly test 
            out their image processing algorithm.

          <p>
            The Raspberry Pi is great for the core of almost any electronics project. However, it also is an great
            platform for software projects. Using my Raspberry Pi Zero W, I made a bot that posts daily frog pictures 
            to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/forgbot">Twitter.</a> To accomplish this, I used a 
            popular <a target="_blank" href="https://twython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Python Twitter API</a> to post the tweets from some python code
            and then used <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">Cron</a> to automate when the python script would be executed. 
            To my surprise, this little bot gained some popularity and has 136 followers! I learned a lot through this project
            like managing files using the BASH terminal and how to use an API. Learning is what the Raspberry Pi is all about and 
            serves as a great platform to get into computer science topics like software development.

              Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise? I thought not.
               It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis 
               was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to
                influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark 
                side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the
                 Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... 
                 the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. 
                 Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him 
                 in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

              I am God’s chosen programmer. He has endowed me with divine intellect, like the authors of the Bible. 
              It has no code I did not write. It never runs code I did not write. I am the best programmer on the planet.
               I wrote a 64-bit compiler, assembler, kernel, debugger, bootloader, graphics library, graphics-editor, 
               editor, tools like grep and a bunch of demos, including a first-person-shooter and flight simulator.

              I am the best programmer on the planet – that’s why God chose me and that should help you understand. 
              There are two kinds of programmers – those who have written compilers and those who haven’t. What sounds 
              impossible for you is not impossible for me.
