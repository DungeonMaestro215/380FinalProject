              discusses a device built on the Raspberry Pi platform to
              monitor water quality in India. It is an interesting engineering problem of how
              to make software use the computer hardware to measure the quality of water.
              It is built using a simple Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) so anyone
              could easily use the device and check their water quality. This device can also report
              the data back to a main hub and allow the tracking of the water quality of all of India.

              <p>
                Here is another example of how the Raspberry Pi is helping researchers.
                In Sogang University, South Korea,
                <a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00371-018-1512-z">a team has
                  created</a>
                what is known as a 4D Light Field
                Camera Array which utilizes a Raspberry Pi cluster to render a graphical representation of
                the photos taken. Although the physics goes beyond the scope of this website, we can still
                appreciate the uses of such a device. 4D Light Fields are used often in 3D computer graphics
                for video games or simulations. This device essentially allows you to record the 4D Light Field
                of a real-world environment and translate it into a computer model. The researchers emphasize the
                importance of the ease of creation and scalability of their design, and they owe this to the low cost
                of the Pi and the modularity of the design.

                  In this article</a>,
                the team of researchers used lidar cameras attached to the Raspberry Pi to detect road signs and detect
                what kind of sign it is. This is a big feat considering the limited computing power of the ARM processor
                on the Raspberry Pi. The algorithm the team wrote captures the images and determines the kind of sign
                all
                in 138 ms! The Raspberry Pi is a great platform for prototyping quickly allowing this team to constantly
                test
                out their image processing algorithm.

                href="https://www.twitter.com/forgbot">@forgbot</a> </h5>

            <p>
              The Raspberry Pi is great for the core of almost any electronics project. However, it also is an great
              platform for software projects. Using my Raspberry Pi Zero W, I made a bot that posts daily frog pictures
              to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/forgbot">Twitter.</a> To accomplish this, I used a
              popular <a target="_blank" href="https://twython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Python Twitter API</a> to post
              the
              tweets from some python code
              and then used <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">Cron</a> to automate when the
              python script would be executed.
              To my surprise, this little bot gained some popularity and has 137 followers! I learned a lot through this
              project
              like managing files using the BASH terminal and how to use an API. Learning is what the Raspberry Pi is
              all
              about and
              serves as a great platform to get into computer science topics like software development.

        <p>I am currently using my Raspberry Pi Zero W to control 32 feet of LEDs in my living room. The Pi
          communicates with the LEDs through its GPIO pins. By running different Python programs, I am able to control
          what patterns appear on the lights. Each of the LEDs can be individually controlled, allowing me to created
          an incredible range of visual effects. This Pi is also hosting a webserver on our local network, allowing
          anyone
          in my apartment to control the lights. I am working on developing my own GUI to provide my friends and myself
          with
          an easy-to-use interface. The low cost and wireless capabalities of this device make it perfect for this
          application.
          I have included a photo of my wiring setup (yes, the Raspberry Pi is on a Command strip attached to the wall)
          and a
          video of one of the light effects in action.

        <p>Additionally, I am hosting a website on my Raspberry Pi 4. This was mostly an educational tool for me to
          learn more about web development and internet security over this past summer. I plan on revamping this site
          using
          the techniques
          I learned this semester in my web deveopment course. I plan on using this to document my past and future
          projects involving technology. This website also hosted a Text-to-Speech I will not provide a link to this
          site here, as it is
          mostly
          just a platform for me to practice development, but it is out there on the Internet.
