                    <p>
                        The Raspberry Pi Project started with very humble beginnings.
                        Eben Upton saw how expensive computers were and did not want it to be a barrier to entry for young kids to learn
                         more about computing. Starting in 2006, Upton worked on developing a single board computer that could be used as
                         an education tool. His goal was to make this board be as small and as cheap as possible. 
                         He made tons of prototypes using breadboards until 2012 when the first Raspberry Pi was released.

            <h5 class="subtitle has-text-grey"> Name Origins</h5>
                <p>
                    The Raspberry Pi name has two parts with each having their own backstory. 
                    The first part, Raspberry, comes from the fruit naming of computers at the time. 
                    Other fruit computer companies at the time were Apple, Acorns, and Apricot computers. 
                    Raspberry also comes from the expression ‘blowing a raspberry’ where you stick your tongue 
                    out and make a sputtering noise. Upton said the childish nature of this really represented the project. 
                    The ‘Pi’ part of the name comes from the early software of the Raspberry Pi. 
                    The first devices had a terminal where you could type Python code.

            <div class="column">
                <h5 class="subtitle has-text-grey">The First Board, Raspberry Pi Model B</h5>
                <p>
                    The first Raspberry was no speed demon but it proved a cheap computer in a small form factor was possible. 
                    It included a single-core ARM processor (ARM1176JZFS) at 700 MHz, 512 MB of RAM, 2 USB ports, an ethernet port,
                    a headphone jack, an HDMI out port, and a composite video out port. 
                    The real big feature on this board wasn't any of that though, it was the GPIO, or general-purpose input/output, pins. 
                    The GPIO makes the Raspberry Pi great as the base for any electronics project, small or large.
                    You can send data and supply power to electronic devices, like motors or LEDs, through these pins.

                        <p>
                            The Raspberry Pi Foundation is an educational charity in the UK founded in 2009. It was created to oversee the
                            development of the Raspberry Pi computers. 
                            This foundation shows Upton stuck true to his original values of making an affordable computer for education. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The main goal of the Raspberry Pi Foundation was to ensure the original values would be kept. 
                            They have done a great job of this and the Raspberry Pi has always stuck at a price point of $35. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another thing the Raspberry Pi foundation did to make learning about computers as approachable as possible 
                            was to make the programming language Scratch. In this language, the user moves around graphical blocks of code 
                            to make simple programs. It has become a great tool to teach kids the basics of computer programming.

            <h5 class="subtitle has-text-grey">Raspberry Pi OS</h5>
                <p>
                    Raspberry Pi OS, formally known as Raspbian, is a Linux distribution created by Mike Thompson and Peter Green 
                    and is built on top of Debian. In the spirit of being a Linux distribution, it is free and open source.  
                    The 32-bit version of the operating system has been around since 2012, but a 64-bit version was released to
                    accommodate the new 8GB RAM model of the Raspberry Pi 4 in 2020.
