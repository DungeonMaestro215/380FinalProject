                                The Raspberry Pi Project started with very humble beginnings.
                                Eben Upton saw how expensive computers were and did not want it to be a barrier to entry
                                for young kids to learn
                                more about computing. Starting in 2006, Upton worked on developing a single board
                                computer that could be used as
                                an education tool. His goal was to make this board be as small and as cheap as possible.
                                He made tons of prototypes using breadboards until 2012 when the first Raspberry Pi was
                                released.

                    <p>
                        The Raspberry Pi name has two parts with each having their own backstory.
                        The first part, Raspberry, comes from the fruit naming of computers at the time.
                        Other fruit computer companies at the time were Apple, Acorns, and Apricot computers.
                        Raspberry also comes from the expression ‘blowing a raspberry’ where you stick your tongue
                        out and make a sputtering noise. Upton said the childish nature of this really represented the
                        project.
                        The ‘Pi’ part of the name comes from the early software of the Raspberry Pi.
                        The first devices had a terminal where you could type Python code.

                            <p>
                                The first Raspberry was no speed demon but it proved a cheap computer in a small form
                                factor was
                                possible.
                                It included a single-core ARM processor (ARM1176JZFS) at 700 MHz, 512 MB of RAM, 2 USB
                                ports, an
                                ethernet port,
                                a headphone jack, an HDMI out port, and a composite video out port.
                                The real big feature on this board wasn't any of that though, it was the GPIO, or
                                general-purpose
                                input/output, pins.
                                The GPIO pins make the Raspberry Pi great as the base for any electronics project, small or
                                large.
                                You can send data and supply power to electronic devices, like motors or LEDs, through
                                these pins.

                                The Raspberry Pi Foundation is an educational charity in the UK founded in 2009. It was
                                created to
                                oversee the
                                development of the Raspberry Pi computers.
                                This foundation serves as an example that Upton stuck true to his original values of making an affordable
                                computer for
                                education.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The main goal of the Raspberry Pi Foundation was to ensure the original values would be
                                kept.
                                They have done a great job of this and the Raspberry Pi has always stuck at a price
                                point of $35.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Another thing the Raspberry Pi foundation did to make learning about computers as
                                approachable as
                                possible
                                was to make the programming language Scratch. In this language, the user moves around
                                graphical blocks
                                of code
                                to make simple programs. It has become a great tool to teach kids the basics of computer
                                programming.

                            emphasize the importance
                            of 'programming competence' and 'maker culture' in this increasingly digital society. The
                            Raspberry Pi project has provided us
                            with a fantastic platform which allows for easier access to making electronic projects.
                            Being well-versed in technology
                            is a skill that is helpful in an ever-expanding number of fields, from science to jouranlism
                            and beyond. Being so cheap and
                            accessible, the Raspberry Pi's provide a resource for schools, clubs, and individuals.

                    <p>
                        Raspberry Pi OS, formally known as Raspbian, is a Linux distribution created by Mike Thompson
                        and Peter Green specifically for the Raspberry Pi
                        and is built on top of Debian. In the spirit of being a Linux distribution, it is free and open
                        source.
                        The 32-bit version of the operating system has been around since 2012, but a 64-bit version was
                        released to
                        accommodate the new 8GB RAM model of the Raspberry Pi 4 in 2020.
